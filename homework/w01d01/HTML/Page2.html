<p>The world’s biggest celebration of urban dance and music culture is coming your way. Since 2008, the World of Dance Tour has put creativity and talent at center stage. We’ll touch down in more than 25 countries across North America, Europe, South America, and Asia. Along the way, more than 50,000 dancers will showcase their skills, plus the stars, success stories, and the urban dance community coming together. That’s serious inspiration.</p><br>
