		<p>Many think of dribbling as simply running with the ball. However, at the highest level of the game, dribbling is more than that; it is the ability to manipulate, control, and move the ball to gain or maintain an advantage. The best players in the world tend to use dribbling for three basic purposes: to beat or eliminate defenders by running past them with the ball, to create new passing lanes and angles, and to maintain possession and control of the ball. Players who use dribbling to good advantage to accomplish one or more of these purposes are often referred to as "having good feet."</p><br>
