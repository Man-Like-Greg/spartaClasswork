// create an array that contains three names\
var namesArray = ["Greg", "max", "KING"];
// use your firstName variable for the third name


// create a variable called numberOfNames that contains the number of people in your names array
var numberOfNames = namesArray.length;
// create a variable called age and put an appropriate data type in it
var age = 24;
// create a variable called younger that contains a third of this age
var younger = 24 / 3;
// create a null variable called empty
var empty = null;
// create a variable called phoneNumber and store this number 07888777396
// ( think about what type of data would be best for this )
var phoneNumber = "07888777396";
